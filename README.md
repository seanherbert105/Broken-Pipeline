# Broken Pipeline

Welcome to the final challenge of how much you learned during this DevSecOps class. The final challenge is the fix this pipeline and have it running correctly again. 

The following files are having errors, I haven't changed any of the other ones.

- pipeline.yaml
- Dockerfile

I also included some hints as comments along the way to assist you in solving this final challenge. 

Good luck, ask for help only if needed. If you can complete this in under 1 hour then you can successfully interview most DevOps technical related interviews at a junior engineer level or have enough technical knowledge to greatly assist you as a DevOps manager.
